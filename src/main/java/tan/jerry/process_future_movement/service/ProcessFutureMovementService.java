/**
 * The {@code ProcessFutureMovementService} interface defines a contract for processing
 * future movement transactions. This interface is designed to be implemented by various
 * classes, each using a different method or algorithm for processing data. The choice of
 * implementation can be based on the specific requirements of the environment or workload,
 * such as performance needs, complexity, or volume of data.
 *
 * <p>This design allows for flexible selection of the processing method:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Sequential Processing</b>: Suitable for low-volume environments or during
 *   development, where the overhead of parallel processing is unnecessary.</li>
 *   <li><b>Parallel Streams</b>: Used when the workload is high and can benefit from parallel
 *   processing, but when the work can be done in parallel chunks without needing specific order.</li>
 *   <li><b>MapReduce</b>: Appropriate for situations where tasks can be divided into separate
 *   map and reduce phases, providing good performance in a scalable manner, especially
 *   when dealing with large data sets.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The interface allows for easy swapping of the processing logic by selecting the appropriate
 * implementation class based on the configuration or runtime conditions.
